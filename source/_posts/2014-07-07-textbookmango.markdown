#### Background
`TextbookMango` is an unforgettable memory of mine. In late 2013, I met my ambitious partners in university when I was studying for my Master's degree in Software Engineering. Then together, we started `TextBookMango` - a small book shop in Pirie Street renting and selling textbooks through [the website](http://www.textbookmango.com){:target="_blank"}.

I could still feel the joy of those moments when our website was finally online, when the sales inbox got the first order email, when we welcomed the first customer in our store, and so on.

Although we had to eventually close our business after 3 years of hard work without seeing expected profit growth, all of us learned a lot by joining our efforts to run such a real business for literally 36 months.

#### Technology
- This is a low-cost Magento web store with friendly UI, good customer experience (one-page-checkout) and easy-to-use admin.
- The rented book tracking and selling request are implemented by developing Magento plugins.
- The payment gateway is integrated using the eWAY Magento plugin from the Magento Marketplace.
- The project was firstly hosted in Linode.com then migrated to AWS.
