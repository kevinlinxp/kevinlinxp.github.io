#### Background
[Nymet Australia](http://www.nymet.com.au/){:target="_blank"} sells "WaterMe", a wireless irrigation controller that can switch on or off valves, collect watering metrics, and communicate with [https://www.control-me.net](https://www.control-me.net){:target="_blank"} (HTTP get every 10 seconds). Customers can register their purchased devices on this website and manage them remotely.

#### Technology
- The back-end technology stack is a typical combination of Spring MVC and Hibernate with RESTful APIs (Jersey).
- The front-end uses JSP with AngularJS to create an interactive UI for the system users.
- This small real-time project is fully covered with unit and integration tests.
