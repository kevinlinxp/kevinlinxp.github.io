[Open demo](../../../angular-dnd-builder){:target="_blank"}

This is a simplified version of `Form Builder` - the front-end part of my current project `RDS Workflow System Builder` - rewritten from [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/){:target="_blank"} to [Angular](https://angular.io/){:target="_blank"}.

_The size of this demo is 3MB and it will send remote calls to my cheap back-end server which is in the US. So please wait for a few seconds for it to load, or just refresh the page if it takes too long._
