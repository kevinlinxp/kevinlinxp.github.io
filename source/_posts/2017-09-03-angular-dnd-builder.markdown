[Go to demo](../../../angular-dnd-builder){:target="_blank"}

This is a simplified version of `Form Builder` - the front-end part of my current project `RDS Workflow System Builder` - rewritten in [Angular](https://angular.io/){:target="_blank"} (instead of AngularJS) just as a personal interest in learning this framework and TypeScript.

PS: The one I wrote for my company is way more powerful than this demo.
